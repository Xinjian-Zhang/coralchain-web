        title: "Blockchain",
        summary: "A blockchain is a distributed ledger composed of cryptographically linked blocks.",
        details: `A blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger composed of cryptographically linked blocks.
    Each block contains:
    ‚Ä¢ Verified transactions
    ‚Ä¢ Timestamp
    ‚Ä¢ Previous block hash
    
    This ensures integrity, traceability, and prevents tampering.
    
    Key Concepts:
    - SHA-256
    - Merkle Trees
    - Distributed Consensus`

      node: {
        title: "Node",
        summary: "A node is a participant in the blockchain network, storing data and enforcing rules.",
        details: `Nodes participate in the blockchain by:
    ‚Ä¢ Validating and relaying transactions
    ‚Ä¢ Storing ledger data
    
    Types of nodes:
    ‚Ä¢ Full Node: Full blockchain, validates blocks
    ‚Ä¢ Light Node: Partial data, lighter computation
    ‚Ä¢ Validator/Miner: Propose and validate new blocks via consensus`
      },
      consensus: {
        title: "Consensus",
        summary: "Consensus mechanisms allow distributed nodes to agree on the blockchain's state.",
        details: `Consensus ensures that all nodes agree on the current state of the blockchain without a central authority.
    
    Types of consensus:
    ‚Ä¢ Proof of Work (PoW): Miners solve puzzles (e.g. Bitcoin)
    ‚Ä¢ Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators are selected based on staked assets (e.g. Ethereum 2.0)
    ‚Ä¢ Proof of Authority (PoA): Selected, trusted validators maintain the network (e.g. enterprise blockchains)
    
    Each has trade-offs in terms of energy, decentralization, and speed.`

      gossip: {
        title: "Gossip Protocol",
        summary: "Gossip protocols spread data randomly across peers, like rumors in a network.",
        details: `In a gossip protocol:
    ‚Ä¢ Each node shares updates with a few random peers
    ‚Ä¢ Information spreads exponentially
    
    This model:
    ‚Ä¢ Is robust and decentralized
    ‚Ä¢ Enables rapid block/transaction propagation
    ‚Ä¢ Reduces single point of failure`
      },
      byzantine: {
        title: "Byzantine Fault",
        summary: "A Byzantine fault is when a node behaves arbitrarily or maliciously.",
        details: `Byzantine faults occur when nodes:
    ‚Ä¢ Send conflicting or incorrect information
    ‚Ä¢ Attempt to disrupt consensus
    
    BFT algorithms (e.g. PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint) are designed to handle up to 1/3 of faulty nodes and still maintain network correctness.`
      },
      forks: {
        title: "Forks",
        summary: "Forks represent a divergence in blockchain history or protocol.",
        details: `Forks occur due to:
    ‚Ä¢ Conflicting block proposals
    ‚Ä¢ Protocol upgrades
    
    Types:
    ‚Ä¢ Soft Fork: Compatible updates
    ‚Ä¢ Hard Fork: Incompatible, splits chain
    
    Consensus rules usually resolve forks by selecting the longest valid chain.`

      smartContracts: {
        title: "Smart Contracts",
        summary: "Smart contracts are programs that self-execute on the blockchain.",
        details: `Smart contracts are immutable, transparent scripts that enforce conditions like:
    ‚Ä¢ Payments
    ‚Ä¢ Token issuance
    ‚Ä¢ DAO governance
    
    Languages include Solidity (Ethereum), Rust (Solana), and Move (Aptos/Sui).`
